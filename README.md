# fs-cat-blog-page

In this workshop, you will build an HTML only blog page using semantic elements including the main, nav, article and footer elements.

Step 1
In this workshop, you will practice working with semantic HTML by building a blog page dedicated to Mr. Whiskers the cat.

To begin the project, add the <!DOCTYPE html>, and an html element with a lang attribute of en.

Remember that you learned how to build a basic HTML boilerplate like this in the previous module.

Example Code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!--all other elements go here-->
</html>

Step 2
Inside the html element, add a head element.

Step 3
Inside your head element, nest a meta element with the charset attribute set to the value "UTF-8".

Below that meta element, add a title element.

The title element's text should be Mr. Whiskers' Blog.

Step 4
To prepare creating some actual content, add a body element below the head element.
